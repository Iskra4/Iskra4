👋 Hi, I’m @Iskra4

I'm a data enthusiast based in East London with a passion for turning information into clear, visual insights.
I recently completed an 8-week Data Technician Bootcamp with Just IT, where I worked with tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Python, and Azure.

I enjoy exploring data, solving problems, and creating dashboards that tell meaningful stories. I’m always excited to learn something new and build projects that reflect that growth.

👀 Interests: data analysis, visualisation, storytelling, beginner-friendly projects

🌱 Currently learning: Python for data analysis & Azure fundamentals

💞️ Open to collaborate on: data dashboards, mini case studies, and public datasets

📫 Reach me: iskraivanova017@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: she/her

⚡ Fun fact: I love yoga, painting, and trying new recipes — creativity fuels my focus in data!

Thanks for stopping by — new projects coming soon! 🚀
